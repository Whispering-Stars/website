Hi, I'm [SSebigo](https://github.com/SSebigo) and welcome to my blog!

---

*tl;dr* - I'm a Jack of all trades developer.

===

I'm a creative at heart and a developer by trade.

Today, I mainly work with Flutter, although I do occasionally work with JavaScript and its billions of frameworks.

But make no mistake, I'm well versed in web development with all kinds of technologies.
I'd even go so far as to say it's one of my distinctive traits: I like to experiment with different technologies.

Because I'm a creative person, I like to work on visual projects (*websites, mobile apps, emulators, video games, etc.*).

You might come across articles in this blog that are only there to show my non dev work :).
